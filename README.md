# Learning Rust 🦀

My journey learning Rust programming language - documenting progress, projects, and exercises as I build backend development skills.

## About This Repository

This repository contains my hands-on learning projects and exercises as I work through Rust fundamentals and backend development concepts. I'm learning in public to stay accountable, document my progress, and hopefully help others on a similar journey.

## What's Inside

### 📚 Rustlings
My solutions and progress through the [Rustlings](https://github.com/rust-lang/rustlings) exercises - a collection of small exercises to get you used to reading and writing Rust code.

**Current Progress:** Working through the exercises (check the rustlings folder for my solutions)

### 🛠️ Mini Projects
Small projects and experiments as I explore different Rust concepts and features.

### ✅ Todo CLI
A command-line todo application built with Rust - practicing file I/O, CLI argument parsing, and data structures.

## Learning Goals

- Master Rust fundamentals (ownership, borrowing, lifetimes)
- Build practical CLI applications
- Understand systems programming concepts
- Develop backend development skills with Rust
- Write safe, efficient, and idiomatic Rust code

## My Learning Resources

- [The Rust Programming Language Book](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/)
- [Rustlings Exercises](https://github.com/rust-lang/rustlings)

## Progress Updates

**Started:** November 2025

I'm updating this repository regularly as I complete exercises and build new projects. Feel free to check back to see my progress!
