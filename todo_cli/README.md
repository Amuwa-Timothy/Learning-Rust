## 🚀 Features

- **Add Tasks**: Quickly input new to-do items.
- **View Tasks**: Display a numbered list of all current tasks.
- **Remove Tasks**: Delete tasks by their list number.
- **Persistence**: Tasks are automatically saved to a `tasks.txt` file, so they remain available even after you close the program.
- **Input Validation**: Handles invalid number inputs gracefully.

## 🛠️ Built With
